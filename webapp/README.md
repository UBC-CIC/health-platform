## Dependencies
Before you start deploying, you must have the following dependencies:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/) 
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) 
- Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) tool.
- Install the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) CLI tool.
- Install the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli) tool.

If you do not currently have a configured AWS Account, configure an account with the following instructions:

- Configure the AWS CLI tool for your AWS Account in the `us-west-2` region, using a user with programmatic access and the "AdministratorAccess" policy (moving forward, we will assume you have [configured a profile](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/configure/index.html) called `health-platform`):
  > `aws configure --profile health-platform`

If you already have a configured AWS account, you may use your own configured account to deploy. Please note that if you decide to use your own account to deploy, be sure to change our command line commands to use your profile whenever there is a ```--profile``` command.
```
--profile YOUR_AWS_PROFILE_HERE
```

## Clone The Repository

### Option 1: Clone through the Command Line
First, clone the github repository onto your machine. To do this:
1. Create a folder on your desktop to contain the code.
2. Open terminal (or command prompt if on windows) and **cd** into the created folder.
3. Clone the github repository by entering the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/UBC-CIC/health-platform.git
```

The code should now be in the above folder. Now navigate into the webapp folder by running the following command:
```
cd webapp
```
### Option 2: Clone through an IDE
Using your preferred IDE, paste the git link https://github.com/UBC-CIC/health-platform.git to clone the repository.

This will clone the repository and create a folder for the project. Now navigate into the webapp folder by running the following command:
```
cd webapp
```
Proceed onto the [backend deployment](#backend).

## Deployment
### Backend
The `backend` folder contains AWS CDK stacks and AWS Lambda function code that will manage the data stores and corresponding interactions with the webapp.

Run `cd backend` and follow the instructions in [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend
The `frontend` folder contains the Health Platform dashboard as a React app.

Run `cd frontend` and follow the instructions in [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md).
